# CodeWay Academy
CodeWay Academy is a modern JAMstack educational platform built with Astro, a static site generator that delivers zero-JavaScript by default while enabling interactive components when needed. 

The architecture leverages Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling and Sanity CMS as a headless content management system, ensuring type-safe content delivery through GraphQL.

The application implements server-side rendering (SSR) for optimal performance and SEO, while maintaining a component-based architecture for maintainability and scalability.
